## Getting Started

1. `npm i` - Install dependencies. This might take a while.
2. `npm start` - Run development build. If it doesn't start, make sure you aren't running anything else in the same port. In case you are on a Unix platform, you can try `PORT=3000 npm start`. It will pick up the port from the environment if it's set.
3. Surf to the port shown at terminal.
4. Start modifying the code. The browser should pick up the changes.
